# week1-challenge

In this challenege for Week 1, I will showcase an improved version of a starter code given to me to begin working from.

The image above is a demonstration of how the webite is required to look, from the beginning of editing the HTML, and after once the file has been edited.

One of the first changes that I made was changing the title to 'Horiseon Website', as it was blank in the initial state of the file.

Next, I noticed that a line of code used in the starter HTML could have been replaced with a minimalistic tag instead. A tag using a "div" and "class=header" can be substituted with "header". Following this, the CSS file needed amending as the class tag had been replaced, so in order to do this I removed the "." from each of the headers in the CSS file.

Just below this, another semantic element that I added was the "nav" tag, to simplify the HTML when editing the code. This is to allow an editor to easily identify where different segments of the site are and swiftly navigate.

In addition to this, one structural admendment that I made was adjusting the headers. In the improved code, I have changed these so that they can be viewed in a nmerical order. The final header was "h2", and before this came "h3". I changed the "h2" to "h4" and adjusted the CSS file so that the font size appeared the same as "h2".
