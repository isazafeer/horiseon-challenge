# week1-challenge

In this challenege for Week 1, I will showcase a refactored version of an outdated website given to me to begin working from.

The image above is a demonstration of how the webite is required to look, from the beginning of editing the HTML, and after once the file has been edited.

One of the first changes that I made was changing the title to 'Horiseon Website', as it was blank in the initial state of the file.

Next, I noticed that a line of code used in the initial HTML could have been replaced with a modern, semantic tag instead (better practice with HTML5). A tag using a `<div>` and `"class=header"` can be substituted with `<header>`. Following this, the CSS file needed amending as the class references had been replaced, so in order to do this I removed the `.` from each of the headers in the CSS file, to point to the elements themselves. 

All of the changes I made from the HTML file were reflected in the CSS file, ensuring that the Horiseon website is functional and accessible.

Just below this, another semantic element that I added was the `<nav>` tag, to simplify the HTML when editing the code. This is to allow an editor to easily identify where different segments of the site are and swiftly navigate.

In addition to this, one structural admendment that I made was adjusting the headers. In the updated code, I have changed these so that they can be viewed in a numerical order. The final header was `<h2>`, and before this came `<h3>`. I changed the `<h2>` to `<h4>` and adjusted the CSS file so that the font size appeared the same as `<h2>`.
