# week1-challenge

In this challenege for Week 1, I will showcase an improved version of a starter code given to me to begin working from.

The image above is a demonstration of how the webite is required to look, from the beginning of editing the HTML, and after once the file has been edited.

One of the first changes that I made was changing the title to 'Horiseon Website', as it was blank in the initial state of the file.

Next, I noticed that a line of code used in the starter HTML could have been replaced with a minimalistic tag instead. "<div class="header">" was replaced with "<header>".
